In the Circle class:
    The scale funtion would add the factor to the radius when the comments said it was suppose to be multiplied by the factor.
     I changed this to multiply the radius by the factor rather than add the factor. This was found by the scaleCircles test.

    The moveBy function would add the xOffset to both the x and y coordinates which contradicted the comments above it.
     I changed this by making the xOffset affect the x coordinate and the yOffset affect the y coordinate. This was found by the simpleMove and simpleMoveNeg test when I tried different circles. 

In the Circle1 class:
    The intersection method would only check if the x distance and y distance between the two circles was less than the radius of one of them. 
     I changed the intersection function by changing both instances of radius to (radius + other.radius) so that it would check for interseting circles correctly. The circlesIntersectingFalse found this issue.

In the Circle2 class: 
    The constructor was (y,x,radius) whcih is wrong because the center point according to the constructor in the Circle abstract class is supose to be (x,y,rad).
     This was changed to (x,y,radius) so that the circle would have the correct center point. This problem was found with the moveBy test.

    The intersection method would only check if the distance between the two circles was less than the radius of one of them. 
     I changed this to be (distance < (radius + other.radius)) so that it could identify if they intersected based on both of their radii. The circlesIntersectingFalse found this issue.


In the Circle 1 and Circle 2 interection function both didn't check if a circle was within another circle and not intersecting.
   I fixed this by adding |radius-other.radius| < distance beteen both points. Ihis issue was found with test circlesIntersectingFalse2.
